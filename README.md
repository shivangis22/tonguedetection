TongueDiseaseNet is an innovative and advanced deep-learning project that aims to revolutionize the diagnosis of various tongue diseases using tongue images. Leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this project offers a reliable and efficient tool to detect and identify oral lichens, leukaemia, hairy tongue, oral cancer, and oral thrush.

The project begins with creating a comprehensive and diverse dataset of tongue images. To ensure data quality and diversity, the team collected thousands of tongue images using web scraping techniques from various sources. This unique and curated dataset is the foundation on which the entire system is built.

Utilizing the popular TensorFlow Keras library, the team developed a robust deep-learning model that is capable of achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 90 per cent in disease classification. The model has undergone rigorous training on the prepared dataset to ensure it can accurately identify different tongue diseases.

TongueDiseaseNet is not only about accurate predictions but also about user-friendly accessibility. To achieve this, the team has designed a fast and responsive API using FastAPI. This API serves as the core interface through which users can submit tongue images in JPG format for analysis. The model processes the input image and generates detailed insights into the detected disease, including the confidence of the prediction and recommended treatment options, along with information about symptoms and causes.

For easy and seamless interaction with the application, the team has also developed a user-friendly Flask web application. Within this web application, users can effortlessly upload their tongue images, obtain the predicted results, and explore the valuable information provided about the identified disease.

The key features of TongueDiseaseNet are as follows:

Disease Detection: The model can accurately classify tongue images to identify various diseases such as oral lichens, leukemia, hairy tongue, oral cancer, and oral thrush.

High Accuracy: With a precision of 90 percent, TongueDiseaseNet provides reliable and trustworthy predictions, aiding healthcare professionals in making well-informed decisions.

Informative Results: Along with the predicted disease, the system presents the confidence level of the diagnosis and offers in-depth details about the disease, including symptoms, causes, and potential treatments.

User-Friendly Interface: The Flask web application allows users to effortlessly upload tongue images and receive rapid results without the need for complex technical expertise.

TongueDiseaseNet holds the potential to significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of tongue disease diagnosis, enabling early detection and proactive treatment. With its state-of-the-art technology and accessible interface, this project is poised to make a positive impact on healthcare and improve the lives of countless individuals affected by tongue diseases.
